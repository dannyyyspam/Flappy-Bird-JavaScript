<h2 align="center">Description üìù</h2>
A side-scrolling mobile game with 2D vintage style visuals was called Flappy Bird. The goal was to control "Faby," a flying bird that continuously travels to the right through groups of pipes in a Mario-like fashion. The game is over if the player contacts the pipes. Each time the user touches the screen, Faby quickly flaps upward; if the screen is not pressed, Faby falls due to gravity; each pair of pipes that he moves between awards the player with one point, with trophies being given out for the score at the conclusion of the game. For scores under ten, no medal is given. Scores of ten to twenty are awarded a bronze medal. The player needs to score 20 points to win the silver medal. The gold medal is given to those who score higher than thirty points. Players who achieve a score of forty or higher receive a platinum medal.
There is no variation or evolution in gameplay throughout the game, as the pipes always have the same gap between them and there is no end to the running track, having only the flap and ding sounds and the rising score as rewards.

The game was created without the use of any framework, using only vanilla JavaScript.
